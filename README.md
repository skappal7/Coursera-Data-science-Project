# Data-Science-Projects-Prototypes
This folder contains few of my Data Science Projects, that can be used "as is" or can be further improvized as well.

• Customer Churn Model - This is the most basic version of customer churn model created using random forest algorithm.

• Customer Churn Naive Bayes - This is another version of the customer churn model which is created using the naive bayes classifier

• New Data (EDA) - This jupyter notebook showcases the Pandas Profile Report functionality to perform EDA by typing in few lines of code

• Fake Album Classifier - Is a fun practice project.
